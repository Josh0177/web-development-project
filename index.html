                    I must say that I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at KSU, even though
                    <!-- <br/> in case i need to start a new paragraph-->
                    I have been earning my degree online only. I would say that I have missed out 
                    on some experiences, but my experience has still been enjoyable.

                <p>Personally, I would have to say that I have enjoyed my programming classes and my capstone class, Cyber Defense, the most. 
                    This class will surely be up there by the time I graduate because it has given me even more programming experience outside of the tutoring and udemy courses that I have been completing.
