                <h3 class="intro-header">Background</h3>
                <p>My background in computers started back when I was 14 playing minecraft.
                    I had begun to make my first basic plugin for a custom server that allowed players to spawn in a simple kit for player versus player (PvP).
                    This spiraled me into programming on and off for a while, before dual booting my first desktop computer with Windows and Kali linux.
                    At the time, it was a lot to take on, and I must admit that I got lost in the sauce of computers at the time and ended up taking a break from them.
                    Fast forward a few years, I may not have been doing exactly the same stuff, but playing video games and fiddling with computers has always been something
                    that I have enjoyed. Now, I am 23, still doing the same stuff for fun and more with programming. While my degree may be for Cybersecurity, I hope to
                    put it to use within a possible programming job as well. 
                </p>

                <!-- adding in experiences sub-block -->
                <h3 class="intro-header">Experiences</h3>
                <p>My overall experience with computers ties heavily into my family's background, as without them, I most likely would have just continued playing baseball 
                    until the end of time. From my first laptop back in 2013, to my first desktop PC in 2015, my computer experience steadily built up all the way until now. I
                    have been meeting with a mentor every few weeks for about half a year now to discuss my progress in helping me slowly prepare for a job in the computer science
                    field. The world of programming has certainly been an interesting one, and with the somewhat recent introduction of html, css, and javascript (a few months ago), and a discord
                    bot later, here I am doing what I enjoy, programming a website that actually has color and some substance to it.

                <h3 class="intro-header">Goals</h3>
                <p>My goals at the moment are to build up enough experience through personal projects, projects with friends, school, and udemy courses, to find myself a job. 
                    I hope to be able to find a stable enough job where I can travel at least once every few years to see the rest of the world, possibly even moving
                    out of the United States and working remotely. I also want to work on my fitness goals as I have been working out now for a while, but am hoping to keep
                    that progress as equal and consistent as I have with what I have been managing with my classes so far for now.
